     <div class="mainpara" align="left"> July 15th, 2016 marked a significant change regarding Turkey’s political history as well as a shift in terms of the freedom that the press within the country has. <br>On this night, Turkey witnessed a coup attempt by a section of the Turkish military. A coordinated operation was launched in several major cities in hopes of removing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan from office. </div>
    
    <br>
    
       <div class="mainpara" align="left"> However, with the news of the coup attempt being spread throughout social media, thousands of ordinary citizens gathered in the streets to oppose the attempted take-over. With the inclusion of ordinary citizens and loyal soldiers, they defeated the coup attempt in hours. The involved scores of troops surrendered on the Bosphrus Bridge in Istanbul.  </div>

    <p style="page-break-before: always">
    
    
    <div class="bodytext" align="right"> According to Al Jazeera, the government blame Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish preacher and businessman who has put themselves into exile in the United States since 1999. He is the leader of an influential religious movement known as “Hizmet” (Service) which owns foundations, associations, media organisations and schools in Turkey and abroad. However, Gülen issued a statement condemning the military in attempting to take over the government. </div>
       
       <br>
   
    <div class="quote" align="left">“Those who stain the military’s reputation must leave. The process has started today and it will continue just as we fight other terrorist groups,” - President Erdogan</div>
    
    
       <div class="bodytext" align="right">It is reported however, by DailyBeast, that “Erdogan had been planning a major military purge next month, directed against any Gulenist supporters who hadn’t already been removed from the military ranks” and that “fear of losing their jobs united the officers behind the coup”. Through this, it would have meant that Erdogan would have gained more control over Turkish political life. This has only grown further since the attempted coup, as now Erdogan has begun to control much of the media and news platforms.</div> <br>

<div id="title2">Deniz Yücel</div>
    
<div class="bodytext2">Deniz Yücel, a German-Turkish journalist, was arrested in 2017 over claims that he was spreading “terrorist propaganda” and aiding the FETÖ (Gülen movement) and the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) in inciting violence in Turkey. 
<br>
Yücel is a journalist and publisher who has written for several German publications, including Die Tageszeitung and Die Welt.
<br>After being arrested, Yücel was held without a formal indictment being filed until February 2018. He was eventually released from pretrial detention after a year in prison, receiving strong public support in Germany.
<br>The trial STILL continues, with the latest hearing being held on April 11th, 2019, despite Yücel demanding compensation over “unlawful detention”. 
<br> However, in an interview with Deutsche Welle, Yücel still wants to one day “make news again in Turkey” and that “he would return to his profession after finishing his book”.
</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
        <div id="title3">Why the press?</div>
   
    <div class="deniz"><img src="/images/journalistsprotest.jpg" alt="Journalists protesting" width="630px" height="460px" align="right"> </div>
    
    
<div class="bodytext3" align="left"> As previously mentioned, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan began the crackdown on media outlets and news publications before the failed coup attempt in 2016, but the coup attempts certainly intensified it. Through this, more than 100 news outlets have since been shut down. <br>
    <br>Similar to Deniz Yücel, every journalist that has been jailed in Turkey face anti-state charges. In a report by the <a href="https://cpj.org/reports/2018/12/journalists-jailed-imprisoned-turkey-china-egypt-saudi-arabia.php" text-decoration= none>Committee to Protect Journalists,</a> they found that at least 68 journalists were jailed for their work in Turkey which is slightly lower than previous years. Throughout the course of 2018, dozens more have been jailed or released as prosecutors continue to seek arrest warrants and apply new charges. Those on the periphery of the journalistic profession are also vulnerable. <br>
<br>An example of this is that not only was the journalists from the Gün Printing House arrested according to CPJ, but their list doesn’t include the owner of the printing house, a security guard and several machine operators who were also jailed. Their “crime” was for the involvement of printing Özgürlükçü Demokrasi, a pro-Kurdish daily paper that the government took over and eventually shut down. Those journalists who wrote for the paper were detained on “accusations of supporting the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK”.
